  <p class="line1"><h2>About Me</h2>
    I am a believer in the endless possibilities that a human mind can achieve when put to good use. I believe that humanity was originally designed to do great and wonderful things. However we have fallen off track and instead are destroying the environment. Be that as it may, there is still hope for the future as people like me and other like minded individuals are working to make this world a better place.
    <h3>Background</h3>
  My background is diverse and interesting, depending on who is looking at it. I believe in being positive and speaking life.
    <h3>Education</h3>
    I have completed university, studing science and that's why I love matters relating to physics, computers and outer space matters. University education is a good way of discovering new ideas as relates to ones passion. It's also a good place to make long term friends.
    <h3>Job Experience</h3>
    I have worked for a financial institution for one and a half years. I've also been a project manager at a construction site and also briefly worked as a sales manager.
    <h3>Current interests</h3>
    My current interests are web design, python programming, sporting activities such as basketball and athletics. I also swim and love listening to music.
