  <p class="line1"><h2>About Me</h2></p>
    I am a believer in the endless possibilities that a human mind can achieve when put to good use. I believe that humanity was originally designed to do great and wonderful things. However we have fallen off track and instead are destroying the environment. Be that as it may, there is still hope for the future as people like me and other like minded individuals are working to make this world a better place.
